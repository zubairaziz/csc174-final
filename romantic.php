						<p>
							Romantic music is a period of Western classical music that began in the late 18th or early 19th century. It is related to
							Romanticism, the European artistic and literary movement that arose in the second half of the 18th century, and Romantic
							music in particular dominated the Romantic movement in Germany.
						</p>
						<p>In the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literary, artistic, and
							philosophical themes. Famous early Romantic composers include Beethoven (whose works span both this period and the
							preceding Classical period), Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Bellini, and Berlioz. The late 19th century
							saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the dynamic range and diversity of instruments used in
							this ensemble. Also, public concerts became a key part of urban middle class society, in contrast to earlier periods,
							when concerts were mainly paid for by and performed for aristocrats.</p>

						<h3>Etymology</h3>
						<p>The group of words with the root "Roman" in the various European languages, such as "romance" and "Romanesque", has
							a complicated history, but by the middle of the 18th century "romantic" in English and romantique in French were both
							in common use as adjectives of praise for natural phenomena such as views and sunsets, in a sense close to modern
							English usage but without the amorous connotation. The application of the term to literature first became common in
							Germany, where the circle around the Schlegel brothers, critics August and Friedrich, began to speak of romantische
							Poesie ("romantic poetry") in the 1790s, contrasting it with "classic" but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating.
							Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his Dialogue on Poetry (1800), "I seek and find the romantic among the older moderns,
							in Shakespeare, in Cervantes, in Italian poetry, in that age of chivalry, love and fable, from which the phenomenon
							and the word itself are derived."</p>
